# Amazon-E-commerce-Data-Mart-and-KPI-Dashboard-using-BigQuery

# ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
In this project, I built a full-scale E-commerce analytics Data Mart using Google BigQuery based on Amazon sales data.
The goal is to create a professional-grade star schema, enable complex business analysis through clean dimensions and fact tables, and generate business KPIs such as revenue trends and best-selling locations.

# ðŸ“Œ Dataset
Source: Amazon Sale Report.csv (raw e-commerce transaction data)

Columns included: Order ID, Order Date, Status, SKU, Product Category, Quantity, Amount, Shipping City, Shipping State, etc.

# ðŸ“Œ Project Steps
1. Data Cleaning & Staging
Uploaded raw CSV into BigQuery

Parsed and cleaned important fields:

Standardized dates

Removed cancelled orders

Casted numeric fields safely

Created a staging table (staging.stg_amazon_sales).

2. Dimension Tables Creation
dim_product: Clean unique product catalog (SKU, Category)

dim_date: Date breakdown (Year, Month, Day)

dim_location: Customer location mapping (City, State, Country)

3. Fact Table Creation
fact_sales:
Connected transactions to dimensions using IDs.
Columns: ProductID, DateID, LocationID, Quantity, TotalAmount.

4. Analytical Queries (KPIs)
Total Revenue by Product Category

Monthly Revenue Trend

Top 10 Cities by Revenue
